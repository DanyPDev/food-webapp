<strong>The purpose of this website was to familiarize myself with ReactJS and APIs</strong>


For now, this project is front-end focused. However, I am looking foward to create a forum on this website and add my own RESTful APIs.

<strong>What I have learned so far:</strong>

<ul>
<li>ReactJS Hooks</li>

<li>API fetching (sent GET request to API)</li>

<li>Promises with JavaScript async/await</li>

<li>Error handling with promises (resolve, .then/reject, .catch)</li>

<li>Debugging JavaScript</li>

<li>Learned how to use functional components instead of class components</li>
  
</ul>
